    <h2>A staple to the city of Chicago. An extremely delicious, beefy sandwich dipped in a savory gravy.</h2>
    <p>This sandwich is often made with a cheese of your choice. It is topped with hot or sweet Peppers, or both! The sandwich is then either served dry, dipped or wet all on a bread roll or "gravy bread".</p>
    <h4>How I order:</h4>
    <p>Mozzarella cheese, hot peppers and dipped or sometimes wet</p>
